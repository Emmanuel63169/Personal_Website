         </div>
         <div>
            <p>Drawign and painting have been some of my go to's when it comes to havign a quiet day to relax and reflect. With a preference of sketching realistic animals, I find myself taking pictures of the occasional squirrel, rabbit, or even deer that I may come across, just to recreate it on paper.</p>

            <h2>Enjoying Videogames</h2>
        </div>

With a broad taste in videogames, from action packed games in the souls-like genre, to more relaxing and satisfying ones in the rpg genre, there is never a lack of games for me to try out.</p>
